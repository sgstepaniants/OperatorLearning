# Learning Partial Differential Equations in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
This repository contains the code to replicate the results in the paper: "Learning Partial Differential Equations in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces".

The files `rkhs_functions.py` and `training_functions.py` are used to define and train RKHS estimators for the Green's functions and bias terms of fundamental solution operators that appear in many linear PDEs.
